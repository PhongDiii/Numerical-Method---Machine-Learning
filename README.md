# Numerical-Method---Machine-Learning
This repository provide source algorithms and code in Matlab to solve academic problems in the student textbook.
# Main content
I have learned this course in school that got some points below : 
* How to estimate and evaluate by error analysis.
* Perform problem to matrices, system of linear equations,
* Use approximation theory, numerical solution of nonlinear systems of equations,
* Learn about interpolation, numerical differentiation and  integration,numerical solution of differential equations, finding sum of series. 
* Familiar with random numer generation and simulation, introduction to linear programming. Programming and application projects will be emphasized.

# Group Project
GEYSER INSPIRED ALGORITHM: A NEW GEOLOGICAL‐INSPIRED META‐HEURISTIC FOR REAL‐PARAMETER AND CONSTRAINED ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION
This project use approximation theory by GEA, GWO, AHA algorithm to estimate the deep of geothermal construction. 
By establish code in cost function, main, run thoundsands replication among nodes, we take the optimal value with acceptable error about 2%. 
This project use MATLAB code. 

# Update
* I create an excel file that containt solution by question in the textbook
* Present another real problem that guild step by step how to approach and apply this knowledge into reality.
* Build a source code for machine learning apply this knowledge
