# Numerical-Method---Machine-Learning
This repository provide source algorithms and code in Matlab to solve academic problems in the student textbook.
# Main content
I have learned this course in school that got some points below : 
* How to estimate and evaluate by error analysis.
* Perform problem to matrices, system of linear equations,
* Use approximation theory, numerical solution of nonlinear systems of equations,
* Learn about interpolation, numerical differentiation and  integration,numerical solution of differential equations, finding sum of series. 
* Familiar with random numer generation and simulation, introduction to linear programming. Programming and application projects will be emphasized.

# Update
* I create an excel file that containt solution by question in the textbook
* Present another real problem that guild step by step how to approach and apply this knowledge into reality.
